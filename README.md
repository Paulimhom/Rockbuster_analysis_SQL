Analysis of movie rental sales data Sample on PostgreSQL  Database 

## Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing
stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth
management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive. Rockbuster has hired a data analyst for its business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launching strategy for the new online video service.
The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related
queries.

## Key Questions and Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect
data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. They have some questions
they’d like to answer as follows:
 Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
 What was the average rental duration for all videos?
 Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
 Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
 Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
